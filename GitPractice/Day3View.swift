/*
- Arithmetic operators
    operator overloading
    + can both concatenate Strings and add Ints

    compound assignments +=, *=, etc.

    comparison operators: !=, ==, <=, etc.

    conditions


    if Ace + King == 21 {
        print("Blackjack!")
    }

    combining condtions:
        let age1 = 12
        let age2 = 21

        if age1 > 18 && age2 > 18 {
            print("Both are over 18")
        }


    ternary operators
 let firstCard = 11
 let secondCard = 10
 print(firstCard == secondCard ? "Cards are the same" : "Cards are different")

 Switch Statements

 let weather = "sunny"
 We can use a switch block to print one of four different messages:

 switch weather {
 case "rain":
     print("Bring an umbrella")
 case "snow":
     print("Wrap up warm")
 case "sunny":
     print("Wear sunscreen")
 default:
     print("Enjoy your day!")
 }

 range operators:
 let score = 85

 switch score {
 case 0..<50:
     print("You failed badly.")
 case 50..<85:
     print("You did OK.")
 default:
     print("You did great!")
 }
